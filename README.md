# Kilburnazon
Kilburnazon is a full-stack web application developed as part of a Database Systems coursework project.
The system simulates an internal employee management and logistics platform, with a strong focus on relational database design, query optimisation, and efficient data retrieval.

The project demonstrates practical application of database theory through indexing, complex joins, and scalable CRUD operations exposed via RESTful APIs.
